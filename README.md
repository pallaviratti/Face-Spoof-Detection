# Face-Spoof-Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based face liveness detection system to distinguish between real and spoofed (fake) faces using image data. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and preprocessing techniques to detect spoofing attacks such as photos or videos.
Steps: 1.Create and Activate Environment
      2.Install Required libraries
      3.Prepare your custom dataset for real and spoof 
      4.Wite the code in capture_images.py to capture real and spoof images
      5.train the model by running train_model,py
      run predict.py
