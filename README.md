# Face-Spoof-Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based face liveness detection system to distinguish between real and spoofed (fake) faces using image data. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and preprocessing techniques to detect spoofing attacks such as photos or videos.
